        <h2>why I'm here</h2>
        <p>this started out as a hobby, something to do to keep myself sane in quarantine. and it was fun and cute and sharing it with my friends through instagram always provided me with a smile.
i only decided to start selling because of rather unfortunate circumstances. as a kid I always wanted to be a lawyer. i was known for always talking circles around my peers. i was in the process of applying to law school when my mom had a stroke. finances were already tight but now my mom's health and care were a priority. essentially i'm here in an attempt not to shelve my dreams of law school. my mom use to be a manicurist so she was always quite artistic and actually helped (to the extent she could) some of these pieces so i hope you guys like them :)</p>
